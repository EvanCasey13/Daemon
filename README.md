**Abstract**
<br/>
Daemon is a progressive web application that seeks to attract and support users with a heavy interest in gaming. Daemon seeks to contain relevant functionality implemented in a design focused manner with emphasis on the user experience of the application. Research was conducted on existing web applications related to movies, books etc, where it was found that no single application exists to support gaming with relevant and usable functionality. This application provides functionality related to gaming through use of the RAWG API to retrieve game data, functionality includes personal game lists, searching, filtering, pagination, user support with Firebase and a forum to allow for community collaboration. Current trends in UI/UX such as accessible and motion design, modern minimalism, responsiveness, micro interactions and the hover effect were implemented to create a modern application.
